        question: 'What is Morse code?',
        answer: 'Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as sequences of short and long signals, or dots and dashes, which can be transmitted as sound, light, or visual signals. Each character in Morse code is a unique combination of these elements. For example, the letter "A" is represented by ".-".'
    },
    {
        question: 'What are some common uses of Morse code?',
        answer: 'Morse code has been used in various applications, including maritime communication, aviation, and emergency signaling. It remains useful for emergency situations due to its simplicity.'
    },
    {
        question: 'What is the history of Morse code?',
        answer: 'Morse code was developed in the early 1830s by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail as a means of communication for telegraph systems. It played a crucial role in the development of long-distance communication.'
    },
    {
        question: 'What is the international Morse code standard?',
        answer: 'The international Morse code standard, also known as the "ITU Morse Code," is a standardized version used globally for radio communication. It is maintained by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).'
    },
    {
        question: 'Are there ways to write Morse other than the ITU Morse Code?',
        answer: 'There are Korean and Japanese Versions of the Code. The Korean Morse equivalent is called SKATS, short for Standard Korean Alphabet Transliteracy System. The Japanese have the Wabun Code, which puts their characters and pronunciations into Morse code signals. Otherwise, the code can work with languages using the Latin alphabet.'
    },
    {
        question: 'Is Morse code still used today?',
        answer: 'While Morse code is not as commonly used for everyday communication as it once was, it\'s still used in some areas such as aviation, maritime communication, and by amateur radio operators.'
    },
    {
        question: 'What is the significance of "SOS" in Morse code?',
        answer: '"SOS" is a distress signal in Morse code that is universally recognized as a call for help. It is represented by three short signals, followed by three long signals, and then three short signals again (… --- …).'
    },
    {
        question: 'Can Morse code be encrypted?',
        answer: 'Yes, Morse code can be encrypted or encoded further by applying additional cryptographic methods. This can make the Morse code message harder to decipher without the appropriate decryption key.'
    },
    {
        question: 'When was the first successful demonstration of Morse code?',
        answer: 'The first successful demonstration of Morse code was conducted on May 24, 1844, when Samuel Morse sent the message "What hath God wrought?" from Washington, D.C. to Baltimore, Maryland, marking the beginning of practical telegraphy.'
    },
    {
        question: 'Did Samuel Morse receive recognition for his work?',
        answer: 'Yes, Samuel Morse received significant recognition for his contributions to communication technology. He was awarded several honors and accolades, including the Légion d\'Honneur from France and being elected to various scientific societies. His work laid the foundation for modern telecommunications.'
    },
    {
        question: 'Are there any unique uses of the Morse code throughout history?',
        answer: 'A US prisoner of war in Vietnam actually blinked the word "TORTURE" in Morse code when he was on camera. This let the US Government know their prisoners were not being treated as nicely as portrayed. He was released years later and was eventually awarded the Navy Cross.'
